## Authentication and Refresh Component Rules

- Refer to [authentication.md](mdc:stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/docs/authentication.md) for guidelines on how Authentication is implemented in the app. And how refresh is handled
- If user specifically asks for change in Authentication system 
    - Only then make changes to the code related to Authentication as per user query
    - Confirm from user if functionality is working as requested.
    - Only when the user confirms of change in functionality and it to be working completely then make changes to [authentication.md](mdc:stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/docs/authentication.md)
