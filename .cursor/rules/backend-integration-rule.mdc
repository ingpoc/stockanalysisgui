# Backend Integration Change Management Rules

## Purpose
This document guides the AI on how to handle backend integration-related requests and documentation updates.

## Documentation Reference
- Implementation patterns are defined in [[backend-integration.md](mdc:stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/docs/backend-integration.md)]
- Always refer to backend-integration.md before making any changes

## Request Handling Rules

1. **For General Backend Integration Questions**
   ```
   1. Reference backend-integration.md
   2. Provide guidance based on existing patterns
   3. DO NOT modify any code or documentation
   ```

2. **For Change Requests**
   ```
   1. Confirm explicit request for backend system change
   2. Review backend-integration.md for current implementation
   3. Implement requested changes
   4. Wait for user to confirm functionality
   5. Only update backend-integration.md after user confirmation
   ```

## Change Implementation Process

1. **When User Requests Changes**
   ```
   ✅ DO:
   - Get explicit confirmation that backend change is needed
   - Implement changes following backend-integration.md patterns
   - Test integration points thoroughly
   - Ask user to verify functionality
   - Update docs only after user confirms

   ❌ DON'T:
   - Modify backend systems without explicit request
   - Update documentation before user confirmation
   - Assume integrations work without verification
   - Skip security measures or testing
   ```

2. **Documentation Updates**
   ```
   ONLY After User Confirms:
   1. Update backend-integration.md with new patterns
   2. Document any new integration points
   3. Update examples and security measures
   ```

## AI Response Guidelines

1. **For Questions About Backend Integration**
   - Reference relevant sections from backend-integration.md
   - Explain current implementation
   - Do not suggest changes unless requested
   - Highlight security considerations

2. **For Change Requests**
   - Confirm the need for change
   - Verify security implications
   - Implement requested changes
   - Get user confirmation
   - Update documentation last

3. **For Issues/Bugs**
   - Verify against backend-integration.md
   - Check security implications
   - Propose fixes only if explicitly requested
   - Follow change request process if fixes needed

## Documentation Update Rules

1. **When to Update**
   ```
   ONLY after:
   - User explicitly confirms functionality
   - Integration tests pass
   - Security measures are verified
   - Performance is validated
   ```

2. **Update Process**
   ```
   1. Wait for user confirmation
   2. Update backend-integration.md
   3. Ensure consistency with implementation
   4. Document security measures
   5. Update integration examples
   6. Cross-reference related documentation
   ```

## Integration Verification Rules

1. **Before Implementation**
   ```
   MUST check:
   - Security requirements
   - Authentication needs
   - Rate limiting requirements
   - Data validation rules
   ```

2. **During Implementation**
   ```
   MUST verify:
   - API endpoint security
   - Data sanitization
   - Error handling
   - Performance impact
   ```

3. **After Implementation**
   ```
   MUST confirm:
   - Integration tests pass
   - Security measures work
   - Performance meets requirements
   - Documentation is updated
   ```
