## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Review Past Lessons**
   - Check "Lessons Learnt" section for insights in `@.cursorrules`.
   - Review previous mistakes and corrections in `@.cursorrules`.

2. **Review Knowledge Files**
   - For third-party packages: check `@docs/<package-name>.md`.
   - Verify existing documentation accuracy.
   - Note any missing documentation needs.

### During Development

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep components focused and small.
   - Extract reusable logic to hooks.
   - Maintain consistent file structure.

2. **Code Generation and Lint Errors**
   - During code generation, if faced with lint errors use rule [lint-error-fix.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/lint-error-fix.mdc)

3. **State Management**
   - Use appropriate state level.
   - Implement proper cleanup.
   - Handle loading states.
