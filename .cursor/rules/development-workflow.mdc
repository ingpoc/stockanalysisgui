## Development Workflow

### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Review Past Lessons**
   - Get relevant context from [.cursorrules](mdc:.cursorrules)
   - Check relevant files to gain full context as needed.
   - Search of github or Web or use mcp as needed

### During Development

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep components focused and small.
   - Extract reusable logic to hooks.
   - Maintain consistent file structure.

2. **Code Generation and Lint Errors**
   - During code generation, if faced with lint errors use rule [lint-error-fix.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/lint-error-fix.mdc)


4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper boundaries.
   - Provide user feedback.
   - Log errors appropriately.
   - Handle recovery gracefully.
