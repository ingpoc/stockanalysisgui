# Navigation Change Management Rules

## Purpose
This document guides the AI on how to handle navigation-related requests and documentation updates.

## Documentation Reference
- Implementation patterns are defined in ](/docs/navigation.md)
- Always refer to navigation.md before making any changes

## Request Handling Rules

1. **For General Navigation Questions**
   ```
   1. Reference navigation.md
   2. Provide guidance based on existing patterns
   3. DO NOT modify any code or documentation
   ```

2. **For Change Requests**
   ```
   1. Confirm explicit request for navigation system change
   2. Review navigation.md for current implementation
   3. Implement requested changes
   4. Wait for user to confirm functionality
   5. Only update navigation.md after user confirmation
   ```

## Change Implementation Process

1. **When User Requests Changes**
   ```
   ✅ DO:
   - Get explicit confirmation that navigation change is needed
   - Implement changes following navigation.md patterns
   - Test thoroughly
   - Ask user to verify functionality
   - Update docs only after user confirms

   ❌ DON'T:
   - Modify navigation system without explicit request
   - Update documentation before user confirmation
   - Assume changes work without verification
   ```

2. **Documentation Updates**
   ```
   ONLY After User Confirms:
   1. Update navigation.md with new patterns
   2. Document any new edge cases
   3. Update examples if needed
   ```

## AI Response Guidelines

1. **For Questions About Navigation**
   - Reference relevant sections from navigation.md
   - Explain current implementation
   - Do not suggest changes unless requested

2. **For Change Requests**
   - Confirm the need for change
   - Implement requested changes
   - Get user confirmation
   - Update documentation last

3. **For Issues/Bugs**
   - Verify against navigation.md
   - Propose fixes only if explicitly requested
   - Follow change request process if fixes needed

## Documentation Update Rules

1. **When to Update**
   - ONLY after user explicitly confirms functionality
   - NEVER during implementation phase
   - NEVER without user verification

2. **Update Process**
   ```
   1. Wait for user confirmation
   2. Update navigation.md
   3. Ensure consistency with implementation
   4. Document any new edge cases
   ```
