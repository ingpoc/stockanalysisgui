# Notification Change Management Rules

## Purpose
This document guides the AI on how to handle notification-related requests and documentation updates.

## Documentation Reference
- Implementation patterns are defined in [notification.md](mdc:stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/stockanalysisgui/docs/notification.md)
- Always refer to notification.md before making any changes

## Request Handling Rules

1. **For General Notification Questions**
   ```
   1. Reference notification.md
   2. based on existing patterns
   3. DO NOT modify any code or documentation
   ```

2. **For Change Requests**
   ```
   1. Confirm explicit request for notification system change
   2. Review notification.md for current implementation
   3. Implement requested changes
   4. Wait for user to confirm functionality
   5. Only update notification.md after user confirmation
   ```

## Change Implementation Process

1. **When User Requests Changes**
   ```
   ✅ DO:
   - Get explicit confirmation that notification change is needed
   - Implement changes following notification.md patterns
   - Test thoroughly
   - Ask user to verify functionality
   - Update docs only after user confirms

   ❌ DON'T:
   - Modify notification system without explicit request
   - Update documentation before user confirmation
   - Assume changes work without verification
   ```

2. **Documentation Updates**
   ```
   ONLY After User Confirms:
   1. Update notification.md with new patterns
   2. Document any new edge cases
   3. Update examples if needed
   ```

## AI Response Guidelines

1. **For Questions About Notifications**
   - Reference relevant sections from notification.md
   - Explain current implementation
   - Do not suggest changes unless requested

2. **For Change Requests**
   - Confirm the need for change
   - Implement requested changes
   - Get user confirmation
   - Update documentation last

3. **For Issues/Bugs**
   - Verify against notification.md
   - Propose fixes only if explicitly requested
   - Follow change request process if fixes needed

## Documentation Update Rules

1. **When to Update**
   - ONLY after user explicitly confirms functionality
   - NEVER during implementation phase
   - NEVER without user verification

2. **Update Process**
   ```
   1. Wait for user confirmation
   2. Update notification.md
   3. Ensure consistency with implementation
   4. Document any new edge cases
   ```
