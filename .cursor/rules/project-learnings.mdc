# Project Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

- For AI Guidelines use rule [ai-guidelines-rule.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-guidelines-rule.mdc)
- For development use rule [development-workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc)
- For isssue-fix use rule [issue-fix.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/issue-fix.mdc)
- For lint error use rule [lint-error-fix.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/lint-error-fix.mdc)

<Goal>
Replace the Reown appkit and wagmi implementation with direct Solana implementation while keeping all other functionality and UI intact. 
</Goal>



<plan>
Implementation Plan:
Step 1: Set up Solana Wallet Adapter
Create a new Solana wallet provider setup
Replace wagmi's account management with Solana's wallet adapter
Implement wallet connection modal using Solana's wallet adapter
Step 2: Replace Auth Components
Update ConnectButton to use Solana wallet adapter
Modify auth layouts to use Solana connection state
Update protected layout to use Solana wallet state
Step 3: Update Configuration
Remove Reown appkit and wagmi configurations
Set up Solana network configuration
Configure Solana wallet adapter
Step 4: Update Dependencies
Remove unnecessary wagmi and Reown dependencies
Add any missing Solana dependencies
</plan>


- Keep 3 sections in `@.cursorrules`: Lessons Learnt, Scratch Pad, Best Practises.
- The "Lessons Learnt" section in @.cursorrules should capture specific instances where the AI encountered issues with third-party libraries, documenting mistakes and their resolutions. This fosters iterative learning and prevents repetition. Example entries include:

"[2023-10-01] Error: 'Module not found' for library-z. Solution: Ensured the library was correctly installed and imported. Checked package.json and node_modules, confirming the import statement."

"[2023-10-05] Lint error: 'No overload matches this call' with library-x. Solution: Referred to the library's documentation and found that I was passing incorrect arguments. Updated the function call accordingly."

- Update the section 'Scratch Pad' to jot down tasks which should be completed and would help during new chat sessions to not make a fresh start again. When given a query jot down all the task you will need to perform to complete it in Scratchpad.
- Update the section 'Best Practises' when you uncover certain best practises from documentation or research.
- `@.cursorrules` should not contain any code patterns. All code and patterns should be kept cdocumentation. If required documentation doesn't exist, it should be created in `@docs` folder and `@.cursorrules` should be updated on when to refer to it.
