# Best Practices

- External Resource Reference: "When integrating a third-party library, always check its official documentation and GitHub repository for usage examples, common pitfalls, and reported bugs. This ensures correct usage and awareness of common issues."
- Version Compatibility: "Verify the libraryâ€™s version compatibility with your project and review the changelog for any breaking changes or fixes relevant to lint errors. Check package.json against the latest stable release."
- Robust Testing: "Write unit tests for any code that integrates a third-party library to catch issues before linting. Test edge cases and error conditions to ensure robustness."
- Error Handling: "For third-party libraries, wrap calls in try-catch blocks and check for library-specific error codes or messages. Document these in @docs/<package-name>.md for future reference."
- Community Resources: "If a third-party library issue persists, search Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, or forums for solutions. Record workarounds in 'Lessons Learnt' and @docs, ensuring knowledge sharing."
- Direct Research: "When researching third-party libraries, use the browse_page action to directly access their official documentation or GitHub pages for specific information, enhancing research efficiency."
